Please respond thoroughly (at least two sentences for each question) to
the following three questions.

1. Describe an experience you had this semester where you saw the power of
functions.

    Writing the unfinished multiplayer game for this week. Functions really
    came to power there, including the multiplicity of uses they had, like
    being called as a method for example, and what kind of functions there
    are, like threaded functions. It was amazing to take everything I learned
    this semester and see it all come together in that assignment. I love
    working with functions and I especially love functional and object-oriented
    programming. This project made me really learn to like, love and appreciate
    both and want to pursue them further.

2. In your judgment, what is the value of test functions?

    Since I haven't been exposed to text functions all that much and have neither
    written so many it's still a fairly new concept to grasp and its potential is
    still unknown to me. I'd like to become more familiar with writing test functions
    and how diverse test functions can be. But all in all, the value I've seen so far
    is that they can provide reassurance that your code is working and help you improve
    your programming greatly.

3. Describe your process for troubleshooting and fixing a program that
has a problem. What is one thing you can do to improve your process?

    I'm still in the habit of running my code first before debugging it or writing
    test functions. After altering my code and I still pick up errors I'll either
    use the debugger or I'll outsource, like ask for help or google it, if I know
    what to google. I could improve by getting more familiar with writing test
    functions and by using the debugger more.
