What does maintainability mean?

    The ease with which a software
    system or component can be modified
    to correct faults, improve performance
    or other attributes, or adapt to a
    changed environment.

Why is maintainability important?

    It saves time on projects and allows the
    quality of the software to always be at its peak.

Why do we sometimes neglect it?

    Pressure from clients, deadlines, temptation to
    cut corners.

How can we develop maintainable software?

    Creating well-encapsulated abstractions which are
    easy to understand, using inheritance and polymorphism
    in way that will reduce or eliminate refactioring when adding
    new code.
